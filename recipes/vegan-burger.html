       <li>1/2 red onion, roughly chopped</li>
       <li>1/2 cup brazil nuts</li>
       <li>1/4 cup pumpkin seeds</li>
       <li>1/4 cup hemp seeds</li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
       <li>2 tsp chili powder</li>
       <li>2 tsp cumin</li>
       <li>1 ½ tsp sea salt</li>
       <li>1 14- oz can black beans</li>
       <li>1 cup cilantro, chopped</li>
       <li>1/2 cup quick cooking oats or oat bran</li>
       <li>6 slices of toasted ciabatta bread, or your vessel of choice</li>
       <li>2 cups arugula, mixed greens, or butter lettuce</li>
       <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
       <li>1/2 cucumber sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350° and line a baking dish with parchment paper. Also grab a large mixing bowl, and your food processor.</li>
        <li>Add the red pepper and onion to the food processor, and pulse until minced. Pour into the large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the brazil nuts, seeds, garlic cloves, chili powder, cumin, and sea salt to the food processor, and blend until it has combined into a grainy mixture. Pour into the mixing bowl with the onion and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the beans and cilantro to the processor, and blend until almost smooth (a few chunks of bean is okay). Pour into the mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour your oats into the mixing bowl with the other ingredients, and stir well to combine. The oats will expand and help hold the burgers together.</li>
        <li>Form into tight palm-sized patties, and place each onto the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and use a spatula to flip each burger. Continue baking for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with ciabatta, avocado, cucumber, and arugula.</li>
