    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Pasta:</b> Choose your favorite white or whole-wheat pasta shape such as fettuccine, linguine, penne, or bow ties. Alternatively, you can use gluten-free pasta if you have dietary restrictions. </li> 
        <li><b>Shallot:</b> Provides a mild and sweet flavor to the vegan alfredo. Alternatively, you can use yellow or white onions for a stronger flavor or green onions for a milder savory flavor. </li>  
        <li><b>Mushrooms:</b> Choose your favorite mushrooms, such as oyster, maitake, shiitake, or baby bella. You can also mix and match for a diverse flavor and texture profile. </li>
        <li><b>Olive Oil:</b> Use high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the richest plant-based flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Grapeseed Oil:</b> Oil adds moisture and depth to the mushroom alfredo sauce. You can also swap it for more olive oil. </li>
        <li><b>Soy Milk:</b> Opt for plain, unsweetened soy milk for a creamy base to the sauce. Alternatively, you can use another alternative milk like almond, cashew, oat, or your favorite variation. </li>
        <li><b>Arrowroot Powder:</b> Thickens the sauce to give it a silky smooth texture. Alternatively, you can use cornstarch or tapioca starch.</li>
        <li><b>Nutritional Yeast:</b> The key ingredient for adding a cheesy but dairy-free flavor to the alfredo sauce. If desired, you can substitute cashew cream, vegan mozzarella, or dairy-free parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li><b>Onion Powder & Garlic Powder:</b> Add a savory depth of flavor to the pasta sauce. For the best flavors, always use spices with a good expiration date.</li>
        <li><b>Lemon Juice:</b> Fresh lemon juice adds a bright acidity to the flavor of oyster mushroom alfredo sauce. Alternatively, you can substitute for white wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar.</li>
        <li><b>Sea Salt:</b> Fine sea salt enhances the flavor of the sautéed veggies and the sauce. </li>
        <li><b>Black Pepper:</b> Freshly ground black pepper in a pepper grinder gives the oyster mushroom pasta the best flavor, or you can use pre-ground black pepper. </li>
        <li><b>Parsley:</b> Fresh parsley adds a tasty herbaceous garnish to the pasta and a pop of green color for a gourmet presentation. You can switch up your presentation by using other herbs like basil or thyme. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li> <b>Prepare Pasta.</b> Cook the pasta according to the package directions in heavily salted water. Drain well, then toss immediately with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil in the colander.</li>
        <li><b>Sauté Shallots.</b> Warm the grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and sauté until they turn translucent, for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Add Mushrooms.</b> Add the mushrooms to the skillet with the shallots and add a pinch of salt. Cook until the mushrooms are tender, stirring periodically, for about 8 minutes. </li>
        <li><b>Prepare Sauce.</b>     In a small bowl, combine the soy milk and arrowroot powder (or cornstarch). Whisk well, breaking up any clumps of arrowroot powder, until smooth. </li>
        <li><b>Add Sauce.</b> Pour the soy milk mixture over the mushrooms in the skillet. Immediately stir in the nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, lemon juice, and salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir the sauce and mushroom mixture and cook until the sauce has thickened. Season to taste with more lemon or salt as needed. </li>
        <li><b>Add Pasta.</b> Pour the cooked pasta into the skillet and gently toss together to combine. Serve hot, garnished with freshly ground black pepper and parsley.</li>
